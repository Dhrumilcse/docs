### Install SDK

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have Python `v3.10` or higher installed.
</Info>

Install the sdk via your preferred package manager 

<CodeGroup>

```bash uv
uv add navigator-sdk
```

```bash poetry
poetry add navigator-sdk
```

```bash pip
pip install navigator-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

### Setup logger

There are two ways you can initialize the logger

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="sliders-horizontal" title="Using .env variables">
    Set the following environment variables, all of them are required.

    ```bash
    ENVIRONMENT         = Environment
    NAVIGATOR_API_URL   = https://api.usenavigator.co
    NAIGATOR_API_KEY    = pk_live_abc..xyz
    NAVIGATOR_DOMAIN    = Domain name (i.e. Data Infrastructure)
    NAVIGATOR_SERVICE   = Service name (i.e. Airflow)
    NAVIGATOR_TRACE_ID  = Default trace ID for correlating logs
    ```

    And then initialize the logger with:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash python
    from navigator_sdk import setup_logger

    logger = setup_logger()
    ```

    ```bash node
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="keyboard" title="Initializing at runtime">
    You can also pass the configuration values at runtime

    ```bash python
    from navigator_sdk import setup_logger

    logger = setup_logger(
        environment='production',
        api_url='https://api.usenavigator.co',
        api_key='pk_live_abc..xyz',
        domain='domain',
        service='service',
        trace_id='trace_id'
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

You could also define both. However, note that values defined at runtime will take precedence over env variables. For example, if you need dynamic `trace_id` for each n number of scripts, you can set a default value in `.env` file and override by setting the same at runtime.

### Send logs


Your logger is now ready to send logs. 

```bash python
logger.info("Hello world")
```

Go to [app.usenavigator.co](https://app.usenavigator.co) to start using Navigator.


### Optional Configuration

By default, the logging via sdk is *synchronous* and *best-effort with retries*. You can configure retries and delays but is optional.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="list-start" title="Retry">
    Add these in addition to the required env variables

    ```bash
    NAVIGATOR_MAX_RETRIES       = Number of retries after initial attempt (default: 3)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="loader" title="Delay (exponential backoff)">
    Add these in addition to the required env variables

    ```bash
    NAVIGATOR_RETRY_BASE_DELAY  = Base retry delay in seconds (default: 1.0)
    NAVIGATOR_RETRY_MAX_DELAY   = Max retry delay in seconds (default: 60.0)
    ```
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>
