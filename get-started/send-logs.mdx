### Install SDK

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as a package manager. You can install the sdk via: 

<CodeGroup>

```bash python
uv add navigator-sdk
```

```bash npm
npm i -g navigator-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

Alternatively, if you are using poetry or pip, you can install it via:

<CodeGroup>

```bash poetry
poetry add navigator-sdk
```

```bash pip
pip install navigator-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

### Setup logger

There are two ways you can initialize the logger
1. By setting env variables
2. By initializing at runtime

#### 1. By setting up `.env` variables

You can set the following environment variables in order to automatically setup logger.

```bash
ENVIRONMENT         = Environment
NAVIGATOR_API_URL   = https://api.usenavigator.co
NAIGATOR_API_KEY    = pk_live_abc..xyz
NAVIGATOR_DOMAIN    = Domain name (i.e. Data Infrastructure)
NAVIGATOR_SERVICE   = Service name (i.e. Airflow)
NAVIGATOR_TRACE_ID  = Default trace ID for correlating logs
```

And then initialize by:

<CodeGroup>

```bash python
from navigator_sdk import setup_logger

logger = setup_logger()
```

```bash node
```

</CodeGroup>

#### 2. By setting up at runtime

You can also pass the same variables at runtime to setup logger.

```bash python
from navigator_sdk import setup_logger

logger = setup_logger(
    environment='production',
    api_url='https://api.usenavigator.co',
    api_key='pk_live_abc..xyz',
    domain='domain',
    service='service',
    trace_id='trace_id'
)
```

### Send logs

Your logger is now ready to send logs. 

```bash python
logger.info("Hello world")
```

Go to [app.usenavigator.co](https://app.usenavigator.co) to start using Navigator.
