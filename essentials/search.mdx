Search lets you find specific log messages by searching through log content or error messages. Press `/` from anywhere to start searching.

## Known limitations

- In Alpha, it only searches on log messages within the given time range
- In more stable releases, we will work on improving Search capabilities to be able to search across trace ids, wildcards, custom fields within payload, etc.

## Combining Search with Filters

Search works alongside [filters](/essentials/filter) for powerful queries:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Apply Filters">
    Use filters to narrow down by environment, service, or time range.

  <Step title="Search for a message">
    Search within those filtered results for specific messages or errors.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save as View">
    Save the combination as a [view](/essentials/view) for quick access later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Search results update in real-time as new logs arrive matching your search criteria.
