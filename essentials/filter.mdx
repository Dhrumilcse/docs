Filters help you narrow down your logs to find exactly what you're looking for. Combine multiple filters to create precise views of your system's behavior.

### Quick Access

Press `F` from anywhere to filter on categories and `⌥ 1-6` to shuffle through time range.

### Categories

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="square-asterisk" title="Log Level">
        Filter by log severity to focus on specific types of messages. Use `ERROR` and `CRITICAL` when investigating incidents, or include `INFO` and `DEBUG` during development and troubleshooting.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion icon="zap" title="Operation">
       Filter by specific operations or tasks within your system. Operations represent granular actions like `daily-pdf-export`, `user-authentication`, or `data-sync` that help you track individual processes.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion icon="component" title="Component">
        Filter by logical components that group related operations together. Components represent functional units like `daily-export`, `notification-service`, or `payment-processor` that organize your system's architecture.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion icon="box" title="Service">
        Filter by the service or application that generated the logs. Services represent deployment units like `api-server`, `worker-queue`, `database`, or `scheduler` that make up your infrastructure.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion icon="globe" title="Domain">
        Filter by business or technical domain to organize logs by area of responsibility. Domains represent high-level categories like `data-infrastructure`, `user-management`, or `billing` that help structure your organization's systems.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Time range
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="clock-fading" title="Without active filters">
        Filter logs by time period. Use keyboard shortcuts `⌥ 1-6` for quick access or change through tabs:
        - `⌥ 1` - 30 minutes (default)
        - `⌥ 2` - 1 hour
        - `⌥ 3` - 4 hours
        - `⌥ 4` - 8 hours
        - `⌥ 5` - 1 day
        - `⌥ 6` - 7 days
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="clock-9" title="With active filters">
        When filters are applied, the above still works. However, you cal also press `T` to open the time filter menu.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
