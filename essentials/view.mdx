Views let you save combinations of filters and searches so you can instantly access your most important log queries. Think of them as bookmarks for your monitoring workflows.

### Why Use Views?

Instead of rebuilding the same filter combinations every time production breaks, save them as views and access them with one click.

### Creating a View

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build Your Query">
    Set up the [filters](/essentials/filter) and [search](/essentials/search) you want to save.
    
    For example: env = `production`, level = `ERROR`, service = `api`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save the View">
    Click the "Save View" button or use the save shortcut.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name It">
    Give your view a descriptive name like "Production API Errors" or "Staging Deployment Logs".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Anytime">
    Your saved view appears in the sidebar for quick access.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="Create Views for Common Scenarios">
    Think about the log queries you run most often and save them as views. Production errors, staging logs, specific services - if you check it regularly, make it a view.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="tag" title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Name views based on what you're investigating, not just the filters. "API Gateway Timeouts" is better than "Production Errors".
